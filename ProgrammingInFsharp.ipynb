    "F# is a programming language that encourages you to write in a particular style. This is known as the *functional* style, and it has a few features that can make writing code easier. As this is intended as a basic introduction we won't discuss this in depth but to make a few points that are important to bear in mind.\n",

This code is the F# language; the notebook structure just makes it easier to work with and annotate. There are other ways to use F# but we have chosen the notebook as it makes it easier to combine extensive text and working code. "
