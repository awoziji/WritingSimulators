    "F# is a programming language that encourages you to write in a particular style. This is known as the *functional* style, and it has a few features that can make writing code easier. As this is intended as a basic introduction we won't discuss this in depth but to make a few points that are important to bear in mind.\n",

    "What kind of information a variable contains is known as its *type*. So a variables type can be an integer, or a floating point number etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "There also exist *collections* of variables- for example, a list of integers. A collection is a kind of type, so you can state that this variable is a list of text.\n",

    "This notebook is split into blocks of *text* like this, describing what you should do or think about, or *code* which can be edited (by clicking and editing the text) and run using the *run* button above. This code is the F# language; the notebook structure just makes it easier to work with and annotate. There are other ways to use F# but we have chosen the notebook as it makes it easier to combine extensive text and working code. "
